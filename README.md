# First OS

This is a re-organized source code according to the Udemy course, [Developing a Multithreaded Kernel From Scratch!](https://www.udemy.com/course/developing-a-multithreaded-kernel-from-scratch/).

1. Re-organize codes to keep each sub-directory(chxxx) stands for specific aspect based on my understanding during the course
2. Rename/Re-organize code based on my reading habit. Basically follow the [clean code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/) guidance and my personal preference. Based on Denial's description during the course, his approach is more close to UNIX-like.
3. Keep updating based on my process in course.
